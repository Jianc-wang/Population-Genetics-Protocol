This branch provides instructions for downloading genomes and supplementary metadata from public databases.

If you have no hand you can't make a fist.
When conducting population genetics analysis, the first step is to get the genomes.

Step1: 
Get public genomes

Take Vibrio parahaemolyticus as an example, you can download all of this species.
$ datasets download 

Step2:

$ prefetch SRR3624774.sra


Step3: Get additional information
Thanks to the author "FanXinyue191 https://github.com/FanXinyue191", the metadata info could be accessed by the belowing commands.
(for more detial informatuon, please see "https://github.com/FanXinyue191/BioSample_metadata_extract")
$ wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/biosample_set.xml.gz
$ gunzip biosample_set.xml.gz
$ python biosample_extractV4.0.py --input biosample_set.xml --output biosample_extractV4.0.tsv

Now you got sufficient metericals to conduct Genome analysis.
